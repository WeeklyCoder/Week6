# Week6 | Lingo Dash
Code to liven up this Egyptian game from the 1300 BC often called Tic-Tac-Toe ( O - X )!

## üìÉ Description:
Bring to life this graphics of a brand new game as closely and neatly as you can.

## üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Rules:
The rule is simple. Be the first player to get your symbol in a row.

## ‚ú® Variation:
- See if you can make the code modular such that it may be customized later. For instance, instead of only drawing rectangles, see if you can associate the text, lines, and borders. Let you use variables for what you suspect will change (Eg. Score, Remaining Time, Misses, Definition, Words, Selected Word, Wrong Entries, Player Name, + )

## üí° Where to start? (Ideas)
- Recommended: Click [here](https://github.com/WeeklyCoder/Week6/blob/main/Lingo%20Dash.xd) to access the Adobe XD Design file and refer the dimensions.
- Click [here](https://www.figma.com/file/cT8PtEhspnHaiQAKKgpV61/Weekly-Coder?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=ryojFeN4ROKz9xMk-1) to open the design in Figma.
- Alternatively, you can make use of the XD, SVG, or SVG file provided to get exact/near-exact dimensions.

## Recommended learning:
```- Multidimensional arrays```

```- rect (x, y, w, h, radius) ```

```- text (content, x, y, width, height), textAlign (), textSize (), textFont (), createFont (), +```

```- line (), stroke (), strokeWeight (), ```

## ‚è≥ Submissions:
- Submission of this challenge, just like all of the Weekly Coder‚Äôs challenges, is to be within 36 hours after post. And so, [here](https://t.me/WeeklyCoder/15) Sunday morning 12:00 LT.
